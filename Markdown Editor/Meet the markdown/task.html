<p>Welcome to the first stage of the project! </p>
<p>If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*</code></pre>
<p>Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:</p>
<p><img alt="the beatles members" height="263" name="markdown_editor_1.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7de465ab-f141-41e4-a0c8-39928552b99e/-/crop/366x263/999,324/-/preview/" width="366"/></p>

<p>Print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below. Show your understanding of the syntax basics. You can use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Markdown Guide</a> as it covers all the necessary topics.</p>
<p>Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Here you can see such elements as the <strong>heading</strong>, the <strong>italicized</strong> text, the <strong>strikethrough</strong> text, the text both <strong>italicized</strong> and <strong>bold</strong> (you can surround it with triple <code class="language-markdown">*</code> on each end, for instance: <code class="language-markdown">***Lennon***</code>), and an <strong>unordered</strong> <strong>list</strong>. Once you write the snippet in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:</p>
<p><img alt="the beatles favorite songs" height="295" name="markdown_editor_2.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7304cc76-509f-4a44-a910-3ed01335aa2e/-/crop/343x295/997,319/-/preview/" width="343"/></p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Take a look at the snippet below. This example is for reference only.</p>
<p><img alt="the beatles favorite albums" height="273" name="markdown_editor_3.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/d7b5a78e-c6b1-444a-ae86-3ebe87adc333/-/crop/341x273/997,319/-/preview/" width="341"/></p>
<p>To reconstruct the snippet's structure with markdown, you would have needed to print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># The List of Albums
During their history, a lot of great albums were released.
These are my favorite:
1. Abbey Road
2. Rubber Soul
3. Revolver
4. A Hard Day's Night</code></pre>
