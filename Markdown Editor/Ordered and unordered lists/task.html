<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>There is one more feature that can be very useful! Imagine going to a grocery store, we bet you would need some kind of a list there. Markdown lists are straightforward; there are two kinds of them: ordered and unordered. You've already guessed that the difference between them is that an ordered<em> </em>list itemizes the elements (1., 2., 3., and so on) while an unordered list doesn't do it.</p>
<p>Remember the ordered-list and unordered-list formatters we skipped in the last stage? Let's get back to them!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Implement the <code class="java">ordered-list</code> and <code class="java">unordered-list</code> formatters. You may want to separate the implementation into two different functions, but we suggest keeping them in one; try to get an idea of how to do it!</p>
<p>As in the previous stage, ask a user to input a formatter: <code class="java">Choose a formatter</code>. Keep all the functions you implemented in the previous stage and add two new ones: <code class="java">ordered-list</code> and <code class="java">unordered-list</code>.</p>
<p>Both of the new formatters should require the following input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Number of rows: &gt; 3
Row #1: &gt; First element
Row #2: &gt; Second element
Row #3: &gt; Third element</code></pre>
<p>The number of rows should be greater than zero. If it is not, print the message <code class="java">The number of rows should be greater than zero</code> and ask the user for input again.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Both <code class="java">unordered-list</code> and <code class="java">ordered-list</code> should automatically add a new line at the end. All other formatters should preserve their functionality from the previous stage.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>creating an ordered list.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Choose a formatter: &gt; ordered-list
Number of rows: &gt; 3
Row #1: &gt; First element
Row #2: &gt; Second element
Row #3: &gt; Third element
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element

Choose a formatter: &gt;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>creating an unordered list.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Choose a formatter: &gt; unordered-list
Number of rows: &gt; 2
Row #1: &gt; Fourth element
Row #2: &gt; Fifth element
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
* Fourth element
* Fifth element

Choose a formatter: &gt;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> <em>handling incorrect input and adding new items to the unordered list</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Choose a formatter: &gt; unordered-list
Number of rows: &gt; -2
The number of rows should be greater than zero
Number of rows: &gt; 2
Row #1: &gt; Sixth element
Row #2: &gt; Seventh element
1. First element
2. Second element
3. Third element
* Fourth element
* Fifth element
* Sixth element
* Seventh element

Choose a formatter: &gt; !done</code></pre>
